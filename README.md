# Secure Machine Learning

Related papers in the top-tier security conferences.  We mainly focus on the security problems (both privacy and integrity) when machine learning models are trained or deployed in untrustworthy cloud platforms. The problems are quite pressing as the rapid development of Machine Learning-as-a-Service techniques.
